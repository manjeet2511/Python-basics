        "# Q1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "**Ans:-**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around \"objects\" rather than functions and logic. It aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects, which are instances of that class. It defines the attributes/data and methods/functions that the objects created from the class will have. A class does not hold any actual data itself; rather, it outlines what kind of data and behavior each object will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-**In OOP, an object is a fundamental building block, representing a real-world entity or a conceptual component within a program. It is an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Both abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental to OOP and often used together. Abstraction hides unnecessary details while encapsulation hides sensitive data and ensures controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that are identified by their names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "**Ans:-**Inheritance in OOP is a fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. It promotes code reuse, improves organization, and supports hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In OOP, polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows objects of different types to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q8)  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent accidental modification of data. It's a fundamental OOP principle that bundles data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit — usually a class — and hides internal details from outside interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q9)  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object from a class. It is automatically called when you create an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**Class Method: A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method:A static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but is logically grouped within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q11)  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Method overloading in Python refers to the concept of having multiple methods with the same name within a single class, but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Method overriding in OOP is when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that already exists in its parent class, using the exact same method name, return type, and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python, the property decorator is a built-in feature that allows to define methods within a class that can be accessed like attributes. It essentially transforms a method into a \"managed attribute,\" providing a clean and Pythonic way to control how class attributes are accessed, modified, and deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Polymorphism is important in OOP because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q15)  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-**  OOP offers several advantages, including improved code organization, reusability, and maintainability. It allows for better modeling of real-world scenarios, easier troubleshooting, and enhanced security through encapsulation. Additionally, OOP promotes flexibility and scalability in software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "**Ans:-**n Python, the key difference between a class variable and an instance variable lies in how they are shared and accessed across objects. An instance variable is specific to each object created from a class. It is defined inside the constructor using self, meaning each object gets its own copy of that variable. On the other hand, a class variable is shared among all instances of the class. It is defined directly within the class body, outside of any methods, and is the same for every object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can be derived from two or more base classes, combining their functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q19) Explain the purpose of ‘'__str__' and '__repr__'’  methods in Python.\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python, the '_ _str__' and '__repr__' methods are special methods used to define how an object should be represented as a string. The __str__ method is meant to return a user-friendly and readable string representation of the object, which is used when you print the object or convert it to a string using str(). On the other hand, the __repr__ method is designed for developers and debugging purposes. It returns a more detailed and unambiguous string representation.   \n",
        "\n",
        "#Q20)  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**The super() function in Python holds significant importance in the context of object-oriented programming, particularly concerning inheritance. Its primary significance lies in facilitating the interaction between a subclass and its parent (or super) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**The __del__ method in Python is a destructor used to clean up resources when an object is deleted. It is called automatically when the object is about to be destroyed, but its timing is unpredictable. Due to this, it's better to use context managers with statement for reliable resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**In Python, @staticmethod defines a method that does not access or modify the class or instance and behaves like a regular function within a class. It doesn't take self or cls as its first argument. In contrast, @classmethod takes cls as its first argument, allowing it to access or modify class-level attributes and methods. While both can be called on the class itself, @classmethod is aware of the class context, whereas @staticmethod is not aware of the class context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "**Ans:-**Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the same method name to behave differently based on the object's class. When a method is defined in a base class and overridden in derived classes, calling that method on different subclass instances will invoke the version specific to the subclass. This promotes flexibility and code reuse, as it allows writing general code that works with any subclass without knowing its exact type.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "**Ans:-**Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple method calls are invoked sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself or a modified version of it after performing its operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** he __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When defined in a class, it lets us use the object with parentheses—obj()—which internally invokes obj.__call__()."
