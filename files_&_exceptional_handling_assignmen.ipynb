        "# Q1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Compiled Languages:\n",
        "In a compiled language, a program called a compiler translates the entire source code into machine-readable machine code (or an intermediate bytecode) before execution.\n",
        "This machine code is specific to the target hardware and operating system, once compiled, the resulting executable file can be run directly without the need for the original source code or a separate translation step.\n",
        "Examples: C, C++, Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "In an interpreted language, a program called an interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line at runtime.\n",
        "There is no separate compilation step to produce a standalone executable.\n",
        "Each instruction is translated and executed as it is encountered.\n",
        "Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2) What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "**Ans:-** Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows programs to gracefully manage and recover from runtime errors, known as exceptions, without abruptly terminating. Instead of crashing, the program can \"catch\" these exceptions and execute specific code to handle the error, log it, or provide a user-friendly message.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3) What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The primary purpose of a finally block is to ensure that a specific piece of code, known as cleanup code, executes regardless of whether an exception occurs in the try block or is caught by a catch block.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4) What is logging in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen when program runs. Instead of using print() statements for debugging or monitoring, we use the logging module, which gives us more control and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q5) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The __del__ method in Python is a destructor — a special method that is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e. when there are no more references to it).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q6) What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python, both import and from ... import are used to include code from external modules, but they differ in how the imported items are accessed. When we use the import statement, such as import math, you bring in the entire module, and any function or variable from that module must be accessed with the module name as a prefix (e.g., math.sqrt(16)). On the other hand, the from ... import statement, like from math import sqrt, imports specific components directly, allowing you to use them without the module name (e.g., sqrt(16)). While this can make code shorter and more readable, especially when we only need a few items, it also increases the risk of name collisions if different modules have items with the same name. Overall, import is safer for larger applications, while from ... import is convenient for quick access to specific functions or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q7) How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python, we can handle multiple exceptions using either multiple except blocks or a single except block that handles multiple exception types. This allows our program to respond differently to different errors, or handle several error types in the same way.\n",
        "# Q8)  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The with statement in Python is used when working with files to ensure that resources like file handles are properly managed and released, even if an error occurs during file operations. Its main purpose is to simplify file handling by automatically closing the file once the block of code is exited, whether the program exits normally or due to an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q9) What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Multithreading:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process to run tasks concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads share memory and resources, making communication between them easier but also prone to issues like race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, which limits true parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses multiple separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores, bypassing the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because processes do not share memory, communication is more complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q10) What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Using logging in a program provides several key advantages such as:\n",
        "1.Provides Different Levels of Severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Writes Logs to Files or External Systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Helps with Debugging and Monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Flexible and Configurable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Improves Code Quality and Maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q11) What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Memory management in Python refers to the way Python handles the allocation, usage, and recycling of memory while a program runs. Python manages memory automatically, so developers don’t usually need to manually allocate or free memory like in lower-level languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify the risky code\n",
        "\n",
        "Catch exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "Optional else block\n",
        "\n",
        "Optional finally block.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q13) Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Memory management is important in Python because it ensures that our program uses system memory efficiently and safely, which directly impacts performance, stability, and resource utilization. Proper memory management helps prevent issues like memory leaks, where unused objects remain in memory unnecessarily, causing the program to consume more RAM over time and potentially crash or slow down the system.\n",
        "# Q14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The try and except blocks are the core components of exception handling in Python. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception — it’s where you \"try\" to execute potentially error-prone operations. If everything runs smoothly, the code in the try block completes without interruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "If an error occurs inside the try block, Python immediately stops executing that block and looks for a matching except block to handle the exception. The except block catches the specific type(s) of exceptions you specify and defines how to respond to them, such as logging an error message, recovering from the issue, or cleaning up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q15) How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Python’s garbage collection system primarily uses reference counting combined with a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory automatically and free up unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference Counting:\n",
        "Every object in Python maintains a count of how many references point to it. When a new reference to the object is created, the count increases; when a reference is deleted or goes out of scope, the count decreases. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, meaning nothing in the program is using it, Python immediately frees the memory occupied by that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclic Garbage Collector:\n",
        "Reference counting alone can’t handle reference cycles—where two or more objects reference each other but are otherwise unreachable from the program. To detect and clean up these cycles, Python has a cyclic garbage collector that periodically searches for groups of objects involved in such cycles and frees them if they are no longer accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generations:\n",
        "The cyclic garbage collector organizes objects into generations based on their lifespan. Younger generations are collected more frequently because most objects die young, which improves performance by focusing effort where it’s most needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q16) What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The else block in Python’s exception handling is an optional part that runs only if no exceptions were raised in the preceding try block. Its main purpose is to separate the code that should execute when everything goes smoothly from the code that handles exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q17) What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** In Python’s logging module, there are several standard logging levels that indicate the severity or importance of the messages being logged. The common logging levels, from lowest to highest severity, are:\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBUG (Level 10)\n",
        "Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "INFO (Level 20)\n",
        "General events or confirmations that things are working as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "WARNING (Level 30)\n",
        "An indication that something unexpected happened or might cause problems in the future, but the program is still running.\n",
        "\n",
        "ERROR (Level 40)\n",
        "A serious problem that caused a part of the program to fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "CRITICAL (Level 50)\n",
        "A very severe error indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q18) What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** os.fork() is a low-level, Unix-specific tool for process creation that requires manual management.\n",
        "multiprocessing is a high-level, cross-platform module that simplifies process management and offers robust tools for concurrent programming in Python. For most Python applications requiring multiprocessing, the multiprocessing module is the preferred and more robust choice due to its portability and features.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q19) What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Closing a file in Python is important because it releases the system resources associated with the file, such as file descriptors, and ensures that any data buffered in memory is properly written (flushed) to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q20) What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "file.read() reads the entire content of the file (or a specified number of bytes if an argument is given) at once and returns it as a single string. This is useful when you want to process or load the whole file in one go.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline() reads one line at a time from the file, returning the next line each time it’s called (including the newline character at the end). This is handy when you want to process a file line by line, especially for large files where reading everything at once might use too much memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q21)  What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen when software runs. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs, which helps developers record information about the program’s execution, such as errors, warnings, or general status updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q22)  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "**Ans:-** The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, and when it comes to file handling, it offers a variety of functions to perform low-level operations on files and directories beyond simple reading and writing. This includes tasks like creating, removing, renaming, and checking the existence of files or directories, manipulating file paths, changing permissions, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q23)  What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** while Python simplifies memory management, developers must still be aware of these challenges—especially in large, long-running, or memory-intensive applications—to write efficient and robust programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q24)  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:-** We can manually raise an exception in Python using the raise statement followed by an exception class or an instance of an exception. This allows us to trigger errors intentionally when certain conditions occur in our code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  Q25)  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "**Ans:-** Multithreading helps improve application responsiveness and efficiency in programs with concurrent or I/O-heavy workloads.\n"
