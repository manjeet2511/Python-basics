They provide efficient ways to manage information based on its characteristics and intended use.\n","\n","They are impportant:-\n","\n","*   Choosing the right data structure significantly impacts the efficiency and performance of your program.\n","*   Well-chosen data structures can simplify data manipulation (adding, removing, modifying elements), optimize searching and sorting operations and Conserve memory usage .\n","\n","# Q2) Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples**.\n","**Ans:-** Mutable Data Types: Their content can be changed in place without creating a new object.\n","Example:- Lists, Dictionaries , Sets:- Elements can be added or removed.\n","\n","\n","# Q3) What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","**Ans:-**The main differences between lists and tuples in Python are:\n","\n","**Mutability:**Lists are mutable and Tuples: are immutable\n","\n","**Syntax:**Lists are defined using square brackets '[ ]' and tuples are defined using parentheses '( )'.\n","\n","**Methods:**Lists have a broader range of built-in methods for modification (e.g., append(), remove(), sort()) whereas tuples have fewer methods, primarily count() and index(), due to their immutability.\n","\n","**Use Cases:**Lists are suitable for collections where elements are expected to change frequently, such as storing user inputs or dynamic data and tuples are ideal for representing fixed collections of related items, like coordinates, database records, or function arguments that should not be altered.\n","\n","# Q4)Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","**Ans:-** Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.\n","\n","# Q5) Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","**Ans:-** We might use a set instead of a list in Python when we need to store unique items and perform fast membership checks.\n","\n","# Q6) What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","**Ans:-**In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of characters, used to represent textual data. Strings are enclosed in either single quotes ('pwskills') or double quotes (\"pwskills\").  Strings are immutable, any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string. Lists are mutable, allowing elements to be added, removed, or modified after the list is created.\n","# Q7) How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","**Ans:-** Tuples in Python ensure data integrity primarily through their immutability. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n","\n","# Q8) What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","**Ans:-**A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also known as a dictionary or map. It stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an internal array, allowing for efficient data retrieval.\n","Python's built-in dict type is an implementation of a hash table. When you create a dictionary in Python and add key-value pairs, Python internally uses a hash table to manage this data.\n","\n","# Q9) Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","**Ans:-** Yes, Python lists can contain elements of different data types.\n","\n","For example, a single Python list can simultaneously hold:\n","\n","Integers (e.g., 10, 555)\n","\n","Floats (e.g., 1.23, 2.345)\n","\n","Strings (e.g., \"hello\", \"Pwskills\")\n","\n","\n","Booleans (e.g., True, False)\n","\n","Tuples\n","\n","Dictionaries\n","\n"," etc.\n","\n","# Q10) Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","**Ans:-** Strings are immutable in Python to improve security, performance, reliability, and compatibility with hash-based collections like dictionaries and sets. This immutability ensures string data remains unchanged and consistent throughout our program.\n","\n","# Q11) What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","**Ans:-** Dictionaries are ideal for tasks requiring quick lookups, data mappings, and key-value associations. Lists are suitable for ordered collections, sequential processing, and scenarios where the order of elements matters.\n","\n","# Q12) Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","**Ans:-**  Imagine we are  building a mapping system that stores and retrieves information based on geographical coordinates , mapping each (latitude, longitude) pair to a city name, since tuples are immutable and hashable, this mapping works perfectly. You can't use lists as keys, because they are mutable and therefore unhashable dictionaries require their keys to be immutable.\n","\n","# Q13) How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","**Ans:-** In Python sets automatically eliminate duplicate values it means each element in a set is unique any value inserted more than once simply does not appear again.\n","\n","# Q14) How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","**Ans:-** The in keyword in Python is used for membership testing, but its behavior differs for lists and dictionaries due to their underlying data structures and how they store elements.\n","\n","**For list:-**\n","When in is used with a list, it checks if a given element exists as one of the list's values.\n","\n","**For Dictionaries:-**\n","When in is used with a dictionary, it checks if a given item exists as one of the dictionary's keys. It does not directly check for values.\n","\n","# Q15) Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","**Ans:-** No we can not modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents—such as items, order, and size—cannot be changed. Tuples are intended to represent fixed collections.\n","\n","# Q16) What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n","**Ans:-** A nested dictionary in Python is simply a dictionary whose values include other dictionaries. This structure allows you to represent hierarchical or multi-level data where each key maps to a more detailed grouping.\n","\n","Example of its use case:\n","Representing data for a system that manages information about multiple students, where each student has various attributes including personal details and academic performance. Here student data is nested dictionary.\n","\n","#Q17) Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","**Ans:-**Accessing elements in a dictionary, which is typically implemented as a hash table, generally exhibits a time complexity of O(1) in the average case. This means the time taken to retrieve an element by its key is constant and does not significantly increase with the size of the dictionary.\n","\n","# Q18) In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","**Ans:-** we prefer using a list over a dictionary in situations where the order of items matters, and we need to process elements by their position or sequence for instance, iterating in a specific order, slicing, or sorting values. Lists support duplicate entries, are easy to modify with methods like .append() or .insert(), and offer constant time access by index.\n","\n","\n","#Q19) Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","**Ans:-** Dictionaries are considered unordered because they do not guarantee that the order in which items are inserted will be the same order in which they are accessed or retrieved. This lack of inherent order affects data retrieval because you cannot rely on accessing elements by their position as you would do with lists or tuples.\n","\n","\n","# Q20) Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","\n","**Ans:-** Lists are ideal for maintaining ordered collections where elements are primarily accessed by their position or iterated through sequentially whereas Dictionaries are highly efficient for retrieving data when a specific key is known, making them suitable for mapping relationships or providing quick lookups."],"metadata":{"id":"QXakS-RVRkM9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1 Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","\n","name = \"your
